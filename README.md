# My Portfolio

## About Me
I’m currently pursuing a Master of IT, majoring in Mobile Web Apps, with hands-on experience in iOS, Android, and web development.
I'm actively seeking an unpaid internship opportunity in Australia to strengthen my technical skills and gain real-world experience in mobile development.

I bring strong communication, time management, and problem-solving skills to every project I work on — and I'm eager to contribute and learn in a collaborative environment.
